- it is good that we have code visualized now.
- e8vm.io code should be visualized under e8vm.io
- we can also visualize os8 and toys under e8vm.io for now
- but we will move it to shanhu.io once it can host projects
- at least we have the code and modules for properly visualize a project build
- ?c=103343223 // commit (change list)
- ?d=20150112  // daily build
- ok
- now we need to build a website for writing, running and saving small piece
  of code
- think of it a website for yumuzi234 to write code in your language for fun
- what should the ui be like then?

- block comments are rendered as markdowns
- there might be hidden test cases, which is in another file.
